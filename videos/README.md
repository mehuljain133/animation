# Videos
This repository contains all the source code for the videos published to
https://youtube.com/vcubingx

I don't usually keep this public, so a lot of the code is messy and undocumented and a lot of the commits are poorly named or even useless. 

If you have any questions regarding the code feel free to contact me.
